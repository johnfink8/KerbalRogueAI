# KerbalRogueAI

Wildcard, bitches.  The AI that controls your Kerbal Space Program ships
has gone a little bit rogue.  It might just decide to take you off to 
some unexpected moon or another planet, or it might grapple one of your
satellites and toss it down to the surface.  Whatever it does, there
is no guarantee that it will be successful, nor can you be sure that
you'll be able to get back again.
